### Future
Tasks that are planned for future sprints but not yet ready for immediate execution.
- Process: Regularly review and prioritize these tasks during sprint planning to determine when they will be moved to the "Backlog" or "Ready" status.

Backlog:
- Meaning: Tasks that are prioritized for upcoming sprints but are not yet actively being worked on.
- Process: Refine backlog items, break them down into smaller tasks if needed, and ensure that they are well-defined and ready for implementation.

Pending:
- Meaning: Tasks that are waiting for a specific event or action to be completed before they can proceed.
- Process: Clearly document the reason for the pending status and identify what needs to be resolved to move the task forward.

Ready:
- Meaning: Tasks that are ready to be picked up and worked on by team members.
- Process: Ensure that all dependencies are met, and the task is well-understood before assigning it to team members for execution.

Blocking:
- Meaning: Tasks that are blocked due to external factors or dependencies that need to be resolved.
- Process: Identify the blockers and work collaboratively to address them to unblock the task.

In Progress:
- Meaning: Tasks that are actively being worked on by team members.
- Process: Provide regular updates on progress, communicate any challenges faced, and seek help if needed to ensure smooth progression.

In Review:
- Meaning: Tasks that have been completed and are under review for quality assurance and validation.
- Process: Conduct thorough reviews, address any feedback received, and ensure that the task meets acceptance criteria before marking it as "Done."

Done:
- Meaning: Tasks that have been successfully completed and meet all acceptance criteria.
- Process: Celebrate the completion of tasks, gather feedback for process improvement, and archive task details for future reference.

Failed:
- Meaning: Tasks that were attempted but did not meet the acceptance criteria or were unsuccessful.
- Process: Conduct a retrospective to analyze the reasons for failure, identify lessons learned, and take corrective actions to prevent similar failures in the future.

### Additional Guidelines:
- Updating Task Deadlines: Whenever a task's deadline is changed, ensure that a comment is added under the task explaining the reason for the change and indicating the initial deadline value.
- Communication: Maintain active communication within the team regarding task statuses, progress updates, and any impediments faced to facilitate collaboration and alignment.

By adhering to these defined task statuses and processes, the Scrum team can effectively manage their work items, monitor progress, and proactively address any issues or challenges that may arise during the sprint cycle. üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ
