SMART is Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic, Time-bound

There should be a balance between three types of goals.
- Performance: Finish these projects with this quality
- Hardskill: Learn these algorithms, patterns, frameworks, concepts
- Softskill: Leadership, Habits, Motivate others, Communication, Time management, etc

One should always make sure that goals are aligned with 
- The goals up above in the hierarchy
- The skills and interests of the entities subject to that goal
