# RAPID Decision-Making

There are five ways to have a stake in a decision
* Recommend: Almost everyone can recommend anything.
* Agree/Veto
* Performa: Almost everyone can recommend anything.
* Input: Providing expert knowledge
* Decision: Making the call

## Input
Inputs are ideas, insights, and concerns of people who are either stakeholders and are affected by the decisions or experts in the subject matter. The person with "D" must get input from people who have "I" but doesn’t have to satisfy them all with the final decision.
For examples for a feature that makes the product easier for shops, following people have "I"
* Sales & Marketing
* Tech
* MD(Managing Director/Business Owner)

## Agree
This is the most tricky component of the RAPID framework. People with "A" are mostly experts that can mark dangerous mistakes and should make sure that they are avoided. People who have "A" are really powerful people and can veto a decision. However, with great power comes great responsibility and they should have really strong reasons to veto something. 
For example, in a tech-project, the RAPID is usually as follows: 
* R: Everybody
* A: Tech, MD
* P: Tech, Design, Stakeholders
* I: Tech, Design, MD, Stakeholders
* D: Product 

For example, Product might come up with three solutions: A, B, and C.
It could be that from the head of backend point of view, A might be preffered while B is OK too.
However, solution C migh have significant security risks or performance issues.
In this case, the head of backend can veto solution C but cannot veto solution B just because they think A is superior.

If someone does not use their vetos wisely, it means that are not mature enough for this power and we may have to revise the RAPID.

## Decision
Only one person has D in a specific project or area and they are:
* The ultimate responsible for the success of project or decision making.
* Have the final say unless their decision does not have agree of people with "A"
* Similar to D, the person with "D" has a great power and responsibility. The person who has "D" has the final authority, however, they should make sure that:
* They has built consensus around decisions. It means almost all of team members are aligned and support the final decision in almost all times. Please note the term almost which means not everytime.
* If "D" makes decisions that the team don’t support, they may have to revise it. 
* Decisions are made. they can delegate it to persons more expert in a specific area. However, the responsibility of success or failure of the project is not delegated and they are ultimately responsible.
