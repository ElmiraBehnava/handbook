## Contributing Guidelines

### 5 to 9 Files
For grouping files in directories, following the principle of limited cohesion, which suggests that elements grouped together should have a strong reason to be together, having 5-9 files in a single folder can provide a good balance between manageability and logical grouping. This range allows for a cohesive and focused set of files without overwhelming readers when navigating the directories.

### 4 to 6 Sections
For sections in each file, this range provides a suitable balance between depth of coverage and readability. It allows for a comprehensive exploration of the file's topic without becoming overly lengthy. It ensures that readers can absorb and retain the content effectively.

### 3 to 5 Sub-Bullets
For sub-bullets under each bullet, this range generally allows for adequate layering of information without overwhelming the reader. It provides enough depth to cover essential points while still maintaining a concise and coherent structure. Too many sub-bullets can lead to information overload, while too few may not provide enough detail.
