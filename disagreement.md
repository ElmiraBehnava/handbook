# Hierarchy of disagreement

**Warning!** This article is very opinionated and polarizing.<br/>
It divides people into five groups based on their position towards this article.

| State                                  | Label        | Approach                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Aligned and actively live by values    | Mature       | Encourage and admire                         |
| Aligned but behavior not internalized  | Unseasoned   | Remind, guide and Support                    |
| Unaware of values                      | Uninformed   | Guide and educate                            |
| Aware but disagrees with values        | Astray       | Converse and encourage reconsideration       |
| Aware but defies values                | Manipulative | Establish boundaries and minimize engagement |

For example, if you read the article and agree with it but you are unable to consistently
behave according to it, This article will label you as unseasoned and advices other people
to remind you to behave according to the values and to guide or help you in this path.

**Manipulative behavior** often involves tactics that undermine healthy communication and
can include deflecting, gaslighting, or attempting to control the narrative by shifting 
the focus away from the main issue. These tactics are used to manipulate emotions, silence
opposing views, or establish a sense of superiority. 

# TL;DR;
There are 7 layers of disagreement but the first one is not actually disagreement its just 
stupidity. The layers were taken from the works of Paul Graham, with minor differences. 
A label is assigned to each layer for picking sides and you are further armed with some 
adjectives to attack the enemies of rational conversation.

| Layer | Title           | Label        | Adjectives                         |
| ----- | --------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| DH0   | Name-calling    | Vulgar       | Insulting, Derogatory              |
| DH1   | Ad Hominem      | Manipulative | Narcissistic, Disparaging          |
| DH2   | Deflection      | Deceptive    | Tactless, Defensive, Reactive      |
| DH3   | Contradiction   | Immature     | Oppositional, Dismissive, Stubborn |
| DH4   | Counterargument | Unfocused    | Unattentive, egocentric            |
| DH5   | Refutation      | Unseasoned   | Critical, Analytical, Dissecting   |
| DH6   | Dialectic       | Mature       | Focused, Discerning, Investigative |

If you don't communicate with these standards at the moment, it is OK. What matters is
that you understand right and wrong and you try to move in the right direction.

If you couldn't bear the tone of this document thus far it means that you are impatient 
and that is in-turn immature. In any case, let this line below serve as the harbinger of 
the news that the rest of this article has a more neutral tone. I'm sorry but sometimes 
one needs to be assertive.

The point of this concept is to help people make better arguments for their beliefs, as 
well as have more constructive disagreements with those whose views come into conflict 
with theirs. Preferably, one's argument should be as high on the pyramid as possible while 
still being intelligible, as arguments of this nature are stronger.

Note that 4-7 on the pyramid are fallacious arguments and **must be avoided entirely.** 

![image info](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Graham%27s_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.svg)

## DH0: Name-calling
The crutch of edgy 4chan kids and high school bullies alike.

This is the lowest form of disagreement, and probably also the most common. We've all seen
comments like:

> Example:<br/>
> Foo: I prefer using a desktop computer for graphic design.<br/>
> Bar: LOL, you're dumb. PC master race, E-di0t.

But it's important to realize that more articulate name-calling has just as little weight. A comment like

> The author is a self-important dilettante. 

Is really nothing more than a pretentious version of "u r an idiot."

## DH1: Ad Hominem
You're familiar with this, and it comes in many guises - associative, ad fidentia (or
confidence attack), abusive, circumstantial and hypocritical. Effectively attacking the
authority of the speaking instead of the argument.

> Example 1: (An example of Ad-fidentia that is also an Ad-hominem)
>
> Rick: I had a dream last night that I won the lottery!  I have $1000 saved up, so I am buying 1000 tickets!<br/>
> Vici: Dreams are not accurate ways to predict the future; they are the result of random neurons firing.<br/>
> Rick: The last time I checked, you are no neurologist or psychologist, how sure are you that I can't see the future?<br/>
> Vici: It’s possible you can be seeing the future, I guess.

An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling.
It might actually carry some weight.
For example, 

> Example 2: 
>
> If a senator wrote an article saying senators' salaries should be increased, one could respond:<br/>
> Of course he would say that. He's a senator. 
>
> This wouldn't refute the author's argument, but it may at least be relevant to the case.<br/>
> It's still a very weak form of disagreement, though.<br/> If there's something wrong
> with the senator's argument, you should say what it is; and if there isn't, what
> difference does it make that he's a senator?

Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic is a variant of ad
hominem - and a particularly useless sort, because good ideas often come from outsiders.

> Example 3: My opponent suggests that lowering taxes will be a good idea -- this is
> coming from a woman who eats a pint of Ben and Jerry’s each night!

> Example 4: Tony wants us to believe that the origin of life was an “accident”. Tony is
> a godless SOB who has spent more time in jail than in church, so the only information we
> should consider from him is the best way to make license plates.

#### What should I do if someone attacks me with name-calling or ad-hominem?
1. **Remain Calm:**<br/>
   Maintain your composure and avoid responding with anger or frustration. Reacting emotionally may escalate the situation and hinder productive communication.
2. **Ignore the Insult:**<br/>
   Refrain from engaging with the insults directly. Instead, focus on the substance of the conversation and steer it back to the main points.
3. **Express Disapproval:**<br/>
   Politely express your disapproval of the behavior without stooping to the same level. You can say something like, "I prefer to discuss the topic without resorting to personal attacks."
4. **Set Boundaries:**<br/>
   Clearly communicate that you expect respectful and constructive communication. Let the person know that name-calling is not conducive to a productive discussion.
5. **Redirect the Conversation:**<br/>
   Shift the focus back to the main topic or the issues being discussed. Emphasize the importance of addressing the substance rather than resorting to personal attacks.
6. **Seek Understanding:**<br/>
   If possible, try to understand the reasons behind their behavior. It could be rooted in frustration, misunderstanding, or emotional stress. Addressing the underlying issues can lead to a more productive conversation.
7. **Reiterate Your Points:**<br/>
   Reiterate your main points or concerns in a clear and concise manner. This helps refocus the discussion on the central issues rather than getting sidetracked by name-calling.
8. **Consider Disengagement:**<br/>
   If the name-calling persists and becomes abusive, it may be necessary to disengage from the conversation. Let the person know that you are willing to continue the discussion when it can be conducted respectfully.
9. **Document the Incident:**<br/>
   If these attacks persist and impact the professional environment, consider documenting the incidents for future reference.
10. **Seek Support:**<br/>
   If the situation escalates or becomes a recurring issue, seek support from HR or your manager within the professional setting.

## DH2: Changing the subjet 

There are many different tactics for changing the subject, but the most difficult one to
address is responding to tone, which will be discussed after the others.

### Style Over Substance
When the arguer embellishes the argument with compelling language or rhetoric, and/or visual aesthetics.
This comes in many forms as described below. “If it sounds good or looks good, it must be right!”

> Example: A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. <br/> Explanation: Most
> applications of language, like the example above, are not taken literally, but
> figuratively.  However, even figurative language is a way to make an argument.  In this
> case, it might be used to imply that a team is no better than the least productive
> member of that team which is just not true.  Very often the “weakest links” fade away
> into the background and the strong players lead the team.

### Red Herring (Ignoratio elenchi)
Attempting to redirect the argument to another issue to which the person doing the redirecting can better respond.
While it is similar to the avoiding the issue fallacy, the red herring is a deliberate diversion of attention with the intention of trying to abandon the original argument.

> Example:
>
> Mike: It is morally wrong to cheat on your spouse, why on earth would you have done that?<br/>
> Ken: But what is morality exactly?<br/>
> Mike: It’s a code of conduct shared by cultures.<br/>
> Ken: But who creates this code?...

### Avoiding the Issue
When an arguer responds to an argument by not addressing the points of the argument.
Unlike the strawman fallacy, avoiding the issue does not create an unrelated argument to divert attention, it simply avoids the argument.

> Example:
>
> Mike: Did you test your code before submitting a pull request?
> Ken: Of course I did!
> Mike: But it gives 500 error when I run it.
> Ken: Who died? [Internal Joke]

### Strawman Fallacy
Substituting a person’s actual position or argument with a distorted, exaggerated, or misrepresented version of the position of the argument.

> Example:
>
> Zebedee: What is your view on the Christian God?<br/> 
> Mike: I don’t believe in any gods, including the Christian one.<br/> 
> Zebedee: So you think that we are here by accident, and all this design in nature is pure chance, and the universe just created itself?<br/> 
> Mike: You got all that from me stating that I just don’t believe in any gods?

**Pro Tip:** Get in the habit of steelmanning the argument. The opposite of the strawman is
referred to as the steelman, which is a productive technique in argumentation where the
one evaluating the argument makes the strongest case for the argument, assuming the best
intentions of the interlocutor. This technique prevents pointless, time-wasting bickering
and demonstrates respect for both the interlocutor and the process of critical argumentation.

> Example:
>
> Johan: The progressive left is making it more difficult for me to vote blue this coming election.<br/> 
> Sebastian: Why is that?<br/> 
> Johan: It primarily has to do with the endorsement of the riots.<br/> 
> Sebastian: So if I understand you correctly, you are saying that the democratic establishment appears to be supporting riots rather than condemning them?<br/> 
> Johan: Yes, that is exactly it.
### Responding to tone
Complaining about the way that someone said something, rather than what was actually said.

Though better than attacking the author, this is still a weak form of disagreement.
It matters much more whether the author is wrong or right than what his tone is.
Especially since tone is so hard to judge.
Someone who has a chip on their shoulder about some topic might be offended by a tone that to other readers seemed neutral.

So if the worst thing you can say about something is to criticize its tone, you're not saying much.
Is the author flippant, but correct? Better that than grave and wrong.
And if the author is incorrect somewhere, say where.

> Example:
> I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. 

Tip: The term tone policing is autological so you run the risk of hypocrisy in calling someone out for doing this.

Note that while tone arguments are a form of ignoratio elenchi, or the style over
substance fallacy, they could be relevant in select cases where rhetoric is being
discussed but that is hardly ever the case in professional settings for such discussions
about rhetoric to take place or become problematic.

#### What should I do if someone responds to my tone?
1. **Stay Calm**<br/>
Maintain your composure and avoid responding with anger or frustration. Reacting emotionally may escalate the situation and hinder productive communication.
2. **Appologize**<br/>
Try to calm them down too with respectful applogies.
3. **Acknowledge**<br/>
Acknowledge their comments on your tone briefly.
4. **Reiterate Your Central Point**<br/>
Redirect the conversation back to the central point you originally raised.

For example, you might say:

> I understand you have concerns about my tone, and I'm sorry if I distressed you, but
> I'd like to revisit the main point I made about [central point]. What are your thoughts
> on that?

#### Can I respond to other people's tone if they talk badly to me?
The most important thing here, is for you to have sympathy, you must understand the root
casues of anger and try to understand and address the root cause of the issue. Of course
you can just try to ask or force the other person to supress their anger but you must know
that if they were good at controlling their anger, they probably wouldn't have displayed
it in the first place, so it is probably a better idea to address the root cause of their
anger first and later, in a more casual setting, you can give them feedback and
suggestions to help them control their anger better.

The first thing you should know is that anger is a natural emotion, and sometimes people
express it as a way of venting or releasing built-up tension. In some cultures or social
contexts, expressing anger may be a culturally accepted way of conveying intensity or
urgency. In any case, it is important that you understand anger is a complex emotion and
it can have many different causes, itendifying the cause of the anger is the first step
towards managing it. Here are some of the most common root causes of anger:
1. **Frustration:** Repeater obstacles, challenges, or issues can be very frusterating. If
   you have repeated a mistake you had been given feedback about before, it is important
   that you acknowledge that you have noticed that you have repeated this mistake and that
   you are very sorry and that you are committed to not let this happen again.
2. **Miscommunication:** Many times misunderstandings cause anger, so it could be that
   they have perceived the situation as something much worse than what it actually is,
   knowing this can help you have more sympathy with them.
3. **Feeling Disrespected:** Perceived disrespect, whether intentional or not, can
   trigger anger. People may react strongly when they feel their opinions or contributions
   are undervalued. It is important that you take a moment to think and make sure you have
   not disrespected them. If you have, explain to them that you did not mean to and that
   you are very sorry for what you have said.
4. **Fear or Insecurity:** Insecurity about one's position, competence, or the potential
   outcome of a situation may manifest as anger in an attempt to assert control or
   dominance. It is important that you make sure they do not feel threatened by you, make
   sure to clarify that you come in peace and you just want to persue a win-win solution.
5. **Lack of Control:** Feeling a lack of control over a situation can lead to frustration
   and anger. Individuals may use anger as a way to regain a sense of control. If you
   notice that your behavior has created a stressful and unpredictable situation for the
   other person it is important that you show them you understand that you have caused
   a lot of stress for them and that you are committed to change this.
6. **Personal Issues:** External stressors, personal problems, or unresolved issues may
   spill over into conversations, leading to the expression of anger. So, always try to be
   kind with people, because it could be that they are in a very very bad situation and
   that they really need your support be it a toothache or a personal tragedy.
7. **Protecting Boundaries:** People may use anger to establish or defend their
   boundaries, signaling that certain topics or behaviors are unacceptable. In this case,
   you should explain to them that you truly care about their boundaries and you are
   committed to respecting them. 
8. **Feeling Unheard:** A perception that one's opinions or concerns are being ignored or
   dismissed can result in frustration and anger. If you notice that you have been somehow
   unattentive to them, it is important that you acknowledge their words and show them
   that you are listening, and then explain your limitations to them so that they
   understand that you have listened to them, but have for some reason been unable to take
   appropriate actions.
9. **Perceived Injustice Or Betrayal**: This could either be a misunderstanding or you are
   really at fault, in which case you must acknowledge your fault and ask them to forgive
   you. After all, sometimes people are right to be angry.

So, 
1. make sure to maintain your composture and then maybe tell them you need some time to
   think, this time will help them calm down and help you identify the root cause of their
   anger. 
2. After that, you should first address their concerns and reassure them.
3. Finally, give them some space to calm themself down without explicitly asking them to
   do so and get back to the main point of the discussion. If they failed to calm down,
   you can explicitly ask them to calm down now what you have reassured them that you
   understand their concerns.

Here is a useful template:
> I understand this is **important**, and I'm **committed** to addressing your concerns.
> Can we take a moment to discuss this more calmly and find a solution together?

#### How do I explain to someone that responding to tone is not OK?
I mean, just send them this doc? 

You must understand that this is a very difficult thing to do because these layers that
are so low down the pyramid are dangerous layers, people who communicate with these
tactics are not easy to talk to rationally, it is possible that they respond to your tone
while you are trying to explain that ad-hominem is bad, or just use contradiction when you
tell them name-calling is wrong. But if you were really so interested in arguing with them
about this topic, be wary that they will try to use morality to defend themselves by 
saying things like: 

> If you want to criticise others you must be better than them.
> If some homeless addict gives me advice not to smoke cigarettes, of course I will not
> listen to them!

This is in fact not an argument. Its just a claim. There is no clear rational relationship
between being addicted and giving advice. People who use this argument mean that if the
addict believed in the advice they are giving they would have done it themselves. But this
is very wrong. In fact, nobody understands the pains and troubles of addiction better than
addicts. The problem is that they are simply beyond the point that they can take an action
about it, and that is the reason they are addicts.

Or 

> It is immoral for someone to blame others for something they do themselves.

They might even try to leverage the "style over substance" fallacy and say something like:

> Pot calling the kettle black.

It becomes especially difficult in Iran because we have so many idioms with this concept!

These tactics aim to shift the focus from the original point to a perceived moral issue, 
which may not be relevant to the central argument.

Finally, here is the process for explaining this to people but it is better if they read
it here when they are calm and alone and not when they are in a defensive position.

1. **Be Calm and Respectful**:<br/> Begin the conversation with a calm and respectful tone
   to set a positive and open-minded atmosphere.
2. **Acknowledge Their Perspective**:<br/> Start by acknowledging that everyone has
   different communication styles and may perceive tone differently. This shows that you
   respect their viewpoint.
3. **Express Your Intentions**:<br/> Clearly state that your intention is to have
   a constructive discussion focused on a behavior they have displayed in several
   occasions which you think is not productive, respectfully mentioning several cases this
   has happened without judgement or acquizition.
4. **Emphasize the Value of Focusing on Central Points**:<br/> Reiterate the importance of
   focusing on central points in a discussion. Explain that addressing the main issue will
   lead to a more meaningful and productive conversations.
5. **Highlight the Harm of Distraction**:<br/> Point out that responding to tone can be
   distracting and may divert the discussion away from the key points that need
   addressing.
6. **Provide Examples**:<br/> Share specific examples of how responding to tone can hinder
   effective communication. Illustrate how it can lead to misunderstandings and prevent
   the resolution of the main topic.
7. **Encourage Direct Feedback**:<br/> Encourage the person to provide direct feedback on
   the central point or issue at hand. This emphasizes your willingness to engage in
   a substantive discussion.
8. **Suggest an Alternative Approach**:<br/> Propose an alternative approach to
   communication, such as addressing concerns about tone separately, in a one on one
   meeting or after the main points of the conversation are resolved.
9. **Seek Agreement on Focus**:<br/> Seek common ground by asking if both parties can
   agree to prioritize the central points of the discussion over the tone. This helps
   establish a shared commitment to constructive dialogue. Clarify that this does not mean
   that tone is not important.
10. **Be Open to Feedback**:<br/> Express openness to feedback on your own communication
   style and encourage them to share their thoughts on how the conversation can be more
   productive.

**Note:** Sometimes, explaining other fallacies related to changing the subjet can help people
understand the harms of responding to tone better.

## DH3: Contradiction
Making it known you disagree by reversing whatever the opposing speaker said.

In this stage we finally get responses to what was said, rather than how or by whom. The
lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case, with little
or no supporting evidence.

This is often combined with DH2 statements, as in:

> Example:
>
> I can't believe the author dismisses intelligent design in such a cavalier fashion. Intelligent design is a legitimate scientific theory. 

Contradiction can sometimes have some weight. Sometimes merely seeing the opposing case
stated explicitly is enough to see that it's right. But usually evidence will help.

## DH4: Counterargument
Rather than simply stating the opposite case, do so while backing it up with reason and
evidence. So in response to "We should do X", you'd say "We should not do X because Y"
instead of just "We should not do X".

Forms up to this point can usually be ignored as proving nothing. Counterargument might
prove something. The problem is, it's hard to say exactly what.

Counterargument is contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence. When aimed squarely at
the original argument, it can be convincing. But unfortunately it's common for
counterarguments to be aimed at something slightly different. More often than not, two
people arguing passionately about something are actually arguing about two different
things. Sometimes they even agree with one another, but are so caught up in their squabble
that they don't realize it.

Note: There could be a legitimate reason for arguing against something slightly different
from what the original author said: when you feel they missed the heart of the matter.
But when you do that, you should say explicitly that you're doing it.

## DH5: Refutation
Use their own words against them! Take the argument provided by the opponent and show how
it is wrong using quotes extracted from it. Of course, while refutation is solid, it's
still prone to error - for example, contextomy or hair splitting. Contextomy is removing
a passage from its surrounding matter in such a way as to distort its intended meaning.

This is the most convincing form of disagreement It's also the rarest, because it's the
most work. Indeed, the disagreement hierarchy forms a kind of pyramid, in the sense that
the higher you go the fewer instances you find.

To refute someone you probably have to quote them. You have to find a "smoking gun,"
a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken, and then explain why
it's mistaken. If you can't find an actual quote to disagree with, you may be arguing with
a straw man.

Often, refutation is not a deliberate sabotage of the conversation, but a trap
that the speaker unintendedly lays for the interlocutor and they fall in it and pull the
speaker in the trap with them, undermining the efficacy of the conversation. The pattern
is that the speaker has a valid point to make and some strong evidence to back it, but
they are greedy and in order to look stronger, they add some more false evidence or they
exaggerate some of their correct evidence and this noise distracts and triggers the
interlocutor(Because wrong evidence is extremely seductive) and they react to the wrong
evidence, diverging the subject. It is important not to be greedy and not try too hard to
gather so much evidence to overwhelm the other one. We don't want to win anything, we just
want to communicate our central point with concise and clear evidence.

> Example:
>
> Niki has delayed three dailies this week and missed one completely, Niki's manager is
> unhappy and complains to her saying: "You never show up at dailies, you don't care about
> our ceremonies".
>
> Niki might be unable to identify that her manager is unhappy with her inconsistency and
> think that the manager is unhappy just because they thing she really **Never** joins
> dailies. Thus, the might offer some evidence to prove that she has attended to some
> of the meetings and diverge the conversation.

**Note:** While refutation generally entails quoting, quoting doesn't necessarily imply
refutation. Some writers quote parts of things they disagree with to give the appearance
of legitimate refutation, then follow with a response as low as DH3 or even DH0.

## DH6: Refuting the central point
The most convincing form of disagreement. Here you identify the main point someone is
making and destroy it.The difference between this and DH5 (Refutation) is that there's no
room for error - you pick the central message being conveyed by the opponent and suggest
why it is flawed. It could be considered a subset of DH5 rather than a completely
different level on the pyramid, as structure-wise they are identical.

Even as high as DH5 we still sometimes see deliberate dishonesty, as when someone picks
out minor points of an argument and refutes those. Sometimes the spirit in which this is
done makes it more of a sophisticated form of ad hominem than actual refutation. For
example, correcting someone's grammar, or harping on minor mistakes in names or numbers.
Unless the opposing argument actually depends on such things, the only purpose of
correcting them is to discredit one's opponent.

Truly refuting something requires one to refute its central point, or at least one of
them. And that means one has to commit explicitly to what the central point is. So a truly
effective refutation would look like:

> The author's main point seems to be x. As he says:
>
> [quotation] 
>
> But this is wrong for the following reasons... 

The quotation you point out as mistaken need not be the actual statement of the author's main point.
It's enough to refute something it depends upon.

## What Now?

Now we have a way of classifying forms of disagreement. What good is it? One thing the
disagreement hierarchy doesn't give us is a way of picking a winner. DH levels merely
describe the form of a statement, not whether it's correct. A DH6 response could still be
completely mistaken. 

But while DH levels don't set a lower bound on the convincingness of a reply, they do set
an upper bound. A DH6 response might be unconvincing, but a DH2 or lower response is
always unconvincing.

The most obvious advantage of classifying the forms of disagreement is that it will help
people to evaluate what they read. In particular, it will help them to see through
intellectually dishonest arguments. An eloquent speaker or writer can give the impression
of vanquishing an opponent merely by using forceful words. In fact that is probably the
defining quality of a demagogue. By giving names to the different forms of disagreement,
we give critical readers a pin for popping such balloons.

Such labels may help writers too. Most intellectual dishonesty is unintentional. Someone
arguing against the tone of something he disagrees with may believe he's really saying
something. Zooming out and seeing his current position on the disagreement hierarchy may
inspire him to try moving up to counterargument or refutation.

But the greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations
better, but that it will make the people who have them happier. If you study
conversations, you find there is a lot more meanness down in DH1 than up in DH6. You don't
have to be mean when you have a real point to make. In fact, you don't want to. If you
have something real to say, being mean just gets in the way.

If moving up the disagreement hierarchy makes people less mean, that will make most of
them happier. Most people don't really enjoy being mean; they do it because they can't
help it.
